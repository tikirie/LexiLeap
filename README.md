# Lexi Leap
*Lexi Leap* is a two-player English language learning game where you and a friend can take control of a character on one side of a split-screen and 
leap your way to the top by navigating the sky. Along the way, you will encounter a word and players must quickly decide whether the following 
words you run into are either synonyms that will give you a boost, or antonyms that can hinder your progress. Challenge a friend to test your vocabulary and reflexes 
and see who wins!
