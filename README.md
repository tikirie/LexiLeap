# Lexi Leap
*LexiLeap* is a two-player English language learning game where you and a friend can take control of a character on one side of a split-screen and 
leap your way to the top by navigating the sky. Along the way, you will encounter a word and players must quickly decide whether the following 
words you run into are either synonyms that will give you a boost, or antonyms that can hinder your progress. Challenge a friend to test your vocabulary and reflexes 
and see who wins!

### Dependencies

**Tools we used:** 
- Godot
- Python (in Visual Studio Code)
- Princeton's Wordnet
  - "A large lexical database of English. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept"
  - Princeton University "About WordNet." WordNet. Princeton University. 2010.
- etc.

### Set-up Instructions

### Reflection

We all were very inexperienced with Godot or game development in general, so it was a huge learning curve trying to learn about game development. 
In addition, trying to implement the data taken from our database was also a challenge. But we're proud of how much progress we made toward our game! 
Though we started not even knowing how to open a new Godot project, through a ton of Youtube videos, Googling, and confused questions, we were able 
to make a playable game with some implemented mechanics and visuals. We definitely learned about the game development process as well as the basics of 
source control. More specifically, we learned a lot about Godot and its features and functionality. We also learned how to divide up tasks and work together as a team!

### Future Goals!

We loved working on this project together and rapidly learning a ton of new stuff. Though we weren't able to fully implement all our ideas and visions, 
we made good progress and we might revisit this again. In addition, now that we have some experience in game development, it is a new opportunity for us to explore more.
